# System Design Guide


## Why System Design?
  - System design is a critical phase in the development process of any complex software or hardware system. It involves the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

## Architectural characteristics of web-based applications
  - Some web-based applications use a two-tier architecture, and some use the n-tier architecture that consists of three or more tiers.

	1. 2-tier architecture: A 2-tier architecture, also known as a two-tier architecture, is a software architecture model that consists of two main components or layers: the client and the server. In this architecture, the client is responsible for the user interface and application processing, while the server handles the data storage and database management.
	2. 3-tier architecture: 
	3. n-tier architecture:
