# System Design Guide

## Why System Design?

- System design is a critical phase in the development process of any complex software or hardware system. It involves the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

## Architectural characteristics of web-based applications

- Some web-based applications use a two-tier architecture, and some use the n-tier architecture that consists of three or more tiers.

  1. 2-tier architecture: A 2-tier architecture, also known as a two-tier architecture, is a software architecture model that consists of two main components or layers: the client and the server. In this architecture, the client is responsible for the user interface and application processing, while the server handles the data storage and database management. Here's a simple breakdown of the two tiers:

     - Client Tier (Front-end): This tier represents the user interface and application logic that runs on the user's device, typically a personal computer or workstation.
     - The client is responsible for presenting information to the user, capturing user inputs, and processing some aspects of the application's logic.
     - In a 2-tier architecture, the client communicates directly with the server for data retrieval and storage operations.

  2. 3-tier architecture:
  3. n-tier architecture:
