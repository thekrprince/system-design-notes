# **System Design Guide**

## Why System Design?

System design is a critical phase in the development process of any complex software or hardware system. It involves the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.

It acts as a blueprint for building software systems. Just like an architect wouldn't start building a house without a plan, software engineers need system design to guide development. Here's why it's crucial:

1. **Roadmap**: System design is like a roadmap for building software. It shows what needs to be done and how the different parts fit together.

2. **Future-Proofing**: A good system design considers how the software will be used as things grow, avoiding expensive rewrites later.

3. **Smooth Running**: System design helps create software that works efficiently and performs well, preventing slowdowns and glitches.

4. **Fewer Headaches**: By planning ahead, system design helps identify and avoid problems before they happen, leading to a more reliable system.

In essence, system design is an investment that lays the foundation for a successful software project. It ensures the final product meets user needs, is built to last, and avoids common pitfalls during development.

- To Build a system we need a design. And these are 2 types which is needed.

  - Design: To design we need following-

    a. Requirements.
    b. Architecture.
    c. Interface - Details about how it will be developed.

  - System Components

    a. Systems should be scalable.
    b. Should be secured.
    c. Can be maintained easily.
